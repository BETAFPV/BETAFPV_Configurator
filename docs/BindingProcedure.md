## ELRS Receiver

### USART Receivers
Such Receivers as [Nano-receiver](https://betafpv.com/collections/rx-tx/products/elrs-nano-receiver),is based on the [ExpressLRS](https://www.expresslrs.org/2.0/) project, an open-source RC link for RC applications. ExpressLRS aims to achieve the best possible link performance in both speeds, latency, and range. This makes ExpressLRS one of the fastest RC links available while still offering long-range performance.

### SPI Receivers
A few Flight Controllers and AIOs (e.g.[F4 1S 5A AIO Brushless Flight Control](https://betafpv.com/collections/components/products/f4-1s-5a-aio-brushless-flight-controller-elrs-2-4g)) have been released with ExpressLRS receivers on-board using SPI instead of a regular UART. This means you can build a more compact and lightweight whoop or nano long range rig without the need for an external receiver. 

Because these are SPI-based, the ExpressLRS Code came baked-in in the Betaflight 4.3.0-based custom-built firmware. These usually don't need to be updated. These Flight Controllers will work with any released ExpressLRS firmware.


## Binding Procedure

There are two ways to bind the receiver, as shown below
### Button Binding


1. Put the receiver into bind mode using any of these procedures:
    

	- press the bind button on the flight controller(e.g.[AIO](https://betafpv.com/collections/components/products/f4-1s-5a-aio-brushless-flight-controller-elrs-2-4g))
	
	- power on and power off receiver three times  (e.g.[Nano-Receiver](https://betafpv.com/collections/rx-tx/products/elrs-nano-receiver) )

	- "Bind" button in the Betaflight Configurator, Receiver Page (if can't be found, update the Betaflight firmware).

	- using the CLI, type in **bind_rx** and press enter once. 

	- using the CLI, type in set **expresslrs_uid = 0**, press enter once, then save and reboot


	
2. press the Bind button on your LiteRadio 2/3(ELRS version). The RX and TX should be now bound.

 - case one (Internal RF module):
 
 	 	Power on,and press the Bind button(to the left of the USB port) on LiteRadio once,if the Red LED flahing the radio is in the binding state.

 - case two (External RF module):
 		
		Power on,press the Bind button on External RF module three times, It doesn't have any hints with RGB
	
*Please mind the order, RX first, TX second.*
 
### Binding Phrase
***This step is simple but important. Both the TX and RX NEED to have the same binding phrase or ExpressLRS WILL NOT WORK. Anyone using the same binding phrase as you will be able to control your model, so be unique. Set something memorable, and limit to alphanumeric phrases conforming to the Latin alphabet*. Receivers flashed with firmware builds that do not have binding phrase enabled will support and require the traditional binding method***

The binding phrase is hashed into 6 bytes represented as numbers. These 6 bytes are referred to as the UID bytes. UID bytes are entered into the Betaflight CLI for binding.

Case one (Internal RF module):

1. Set your **custom binding phrase** for your [LiteRadio 2/3(ELRS version)](https://betafpv.com/collections/rx-tx/products/literadio-2-se-radio-transmitter?variant=39537042260102) on [BETAFPV Configurator](https://github.com/BETAFPV/BETAFPV_Configurator/releases).note down the UID bytes commands,save and reboot.

3. If use  AIO with SPI Receiver,That's all you have to do that go to Betaflight CLI and enter the commands which generated by step1 for your Flight control.

5. Or you can upgrade the firmware for your Usart Receiver to Customize yours **bind phrase**

Case two (External RF module):

1. [upgrade the firmware for you External RF module to Customize yours **bind phrase**](https://www.expresslrs.org/2.0/quick-start/tx-betafpv2400/)
2. [upgrade the firmware for you Receiver to Customize yours **bind phrase**](https://www.expresslrs.org/2.0/quick-start/rx-betafpv2400/)

Annotation:***bindphrase** was not used by factory default,The chip ID is used instead for binding* ,which is High confidentiality on account of the chip ID is unique in the world.The downside is that you can only use button to binding
